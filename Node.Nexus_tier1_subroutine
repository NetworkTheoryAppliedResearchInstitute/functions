## STEP 1: PLAN YOUR CONCEPTS

### CONCEPT DISTRIBUTION FRAMEWORK
Plan exactly 10 concepts to embed across your article:

```
INTRODUCTION SECTION: 1-2 concepts
MAIN CONTENT SECTION 1: 3-4 concepts
MAIN CONTENT SECTION 2: 3-4 concepts
CONCLUSION SECTION: 1-2 concepts
TOTAL: Exactly 10 concepts
```

### AGE-SPECIFIC CONCEPT TYPES
Choose appropriate concept types for your age group:

- **Ages 4-7**: Process misconceptions, simple fact reversals
- **Ages 8-11**: Logical reasoning issues, cause-effect confusion
- **Ages 12-14**: Evidence evaluation problems, source credibility mistakes
- **Ages 15-17**: Research literacy issues, methodology misconceptions
- **Ages 18+**: Professional competency gaps, expert-level misconceptions

### PLANNING WORKSHEET
Write down your 10 planned concepts before creating content:

```
Introduction Concepts:
1. ________________________________
2. ________________________________

Main Section 1 Concepts:
3. ________________________________
4. ________________________________
5. ________________________________
6. ________________________________

Main Section 2 Concepts:
7. ________________________________
8. ________________________________
9. ________________________________
10. _______________________________

Conclusion Concepts:
(Use remaining 1-2 from above list)
```

### ✓ QUICK CHECK: Planning Complete?
□ Exactly 10 concepts planned with specific topics identified
□ Distribution follows framework (1-2, 3-4, 3-4, 1-2)
□ Concept types appropriate for selected age group
□ All concepts clearly defined before content creation

### ⚠️ IF SOMETHING'S NOT WORKING:
- Can't identify enough concepts? Review the age-specific concept types above
- Distribution math doesn't work? Remember: total must equal exactly 10
- Concepts too complex/simple? Match the age group parameters
- Stuck on planning? Move to content creation - concepts often become clearer in context
