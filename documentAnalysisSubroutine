# DA SUBROUTINE 
**Preventing Scope Creep and Governance Overreach in Operational Documents**

---

## NEW COMPLIANCE ANALYSIS ADDITION

### **AUTHORITY BOUNDARY EVALUATION FRAMEWORK**
*Detecting when operational documents inappropriately establish governance authority*

#### **Core Diagnostic Questions**

**Document Type vs. Authority Scope Assessment:**
- Does this document type have the authority to establish the governance structures it describes?
- Is the document trying to create authority rather than operate within existing authority?
- Are organizational roles and responsibilities being established or referenced?
- Does the document assume authority that should derive from higher-level governance documents?

**Authority Source Verification:**
- Where does the authority described in this document originate?
- Can the claimed authority be traced to appropriate organizational documents (bylaws, board resolutions, charters)?
- Is the document appropriately referencing existing authority rather than creating new authority?
- Are there authority claims that exceed the document's legitimate scope?

**Governance vs. Operations Distinction:**
- Is this document establishing policy or implementing policy?
- Does the document conflate operational procedures with governance authority?
- Are there sections that should be in separate governance documents rather than operational procedures?
- Is the document creating institutional structures or working within existing structures?

#### **SCOPE CREEP WARNING SIGNALS**

**Red Flags in Operational Documents:**
- **Authority Establishment Language**: "X person/role has authority over..." (should reference existing authority)
- **Governance Structure Creation**: Establishing new organizational roles or hierarchies
- **Policy-Level Decision Making**: Setting organizational policy rather than implementing it
- **Authority Definition Without Source**: Claiming authority without referencing governing documents
- **Version Control Risks**: Embedding governance that requires document updates when authority changes

**Boundary Violation Patterns:**
- Subroutines establishing oversight authority
- Procedures defining organizational hierarchy
- Operational guides creating review processes
- Technical documents setting governance frameworks
- Implementation guides establishing compliance requirements

#### **CORRECTION STRATEGIES**

**Authority Reference Protocol:**
```
INSTEAD OF: "The Program Director has authority for quality assurance"
USE: "Quality assurance follows procedures established in [Program Charter Section X]"

INSTEAD OF: "This document establishes the following review process"
USE: "Review follows the process defined in [Governance Document], implemented as follows:"
```

**Governance Separation Strategy:**
1. **Identify Governance Elements**: Extract any authority establishment or policy creation
2. **Create Separate Governance Document**: Move authority definitions to appropriate governance level
3. **Reference Existing Authority**: Operational documents reference but don't establish authority
4. **Maintain Scope Discipline**: Keep operational documents focused on implementation

**Authority Traceability Framework:**
- All authority claims must trace to bylaws, board resolutions, or approved charters
- Operational procedures reference authority sources rather than establishing them
- Implementation guides work within existing governance rather than creating new governance
- Technical documents avoid organizational authority claims entirely

## ENHANCED COMPLIANCE DIAGNOSTIC QUESTIONS

### **Authority Scope Validation Questions**

**For Operational Documents:**
- "Does this document try to establish authority it doesn't have the right to establish?"
- "Can every authority claim be traced to an appropriate governance document?"
- "Is this document operating within existing authority or trying to create new authority?"
- "Would changes in organizational authority require updating this operational document?"

**For Governance Documents:**
- "Does this document have the appropriate level of authority to establish what it's establishing?"
- "Are the governance structures it creates consistent with higher-level organizational documents?"
- "Is this the right type of document for the level of authority being exercised?"
- "Would implementation of this governance require changes to operational procedures?"

**For Any Document Type:**
- "Is there a clear distinction between what this document establishes vs. what it references?"
- "Are authority boundaries respected throughout the document?"
- "Would someone reading this document understand where authority comes from?"
- "Is the document's scope appropriate to its type and purpose?"

## IMPLEMENTATION IN DA SUBROUTINE

### **Added to Compliance Analysis Section**

```markdown
### AUTHORITY BOUNDARY COMPLIANCE EVALUATION

**Scope and Authority Alignment Assessment:**
Does the document type match the level of authority it exercises or claims?
Are governance elements properly separated from operational elements?
Can all authority claims be traced to appropriate organizational sources?
Are there boundary violations where operational documents try to establish policy?

**Governance vs. Operations Distinction Analysis:**
Is this document establishing authority or operating within existing authority?
Are organizational roles and hierarchies being created or referenced?
Do authority claims exceed the document's legitimate scope?
Would authority changes require operational document updates?
```

### **Authority Boundary Diagnostic Protocol**

**Step 1: Document Type Classification**
- Operational Procedure (implements authority)
- Governance Document (establishes authority)  
- Policy Document (creates institutional rules)
- Technical Specification (describes functionality)

**Step 2: Authority Claim Inventory**
- List all authority claims in the document
- Identify source of each claimed authority
- Flag unsourced or inappropriate authority claims

**Step 3: Boundary Violation Detection**
- Check for operational documents establishing governance
- Look for technical documents creating organizational authority
- Identify policy-level decisions in implementation guides

**Step 4: Correction Pathway Development**
- Separate governance from operations
- Reference appropriate authority sources
- Maintain document scope discipline

## PREVENTION STRATEGY RECOMMENDATIONS

### **Document Creation Guidelines**

**Before Writing Any Document, Ask:**
1. **What type of document am I creating?** (operational/governance/policy/technical)
2. **What authority does this document type have?** (none/implementation/organizational/institutional)
3. **Am I establishing authority or operating within authority?** (establishing requires higher-level approval)
4. **Can I trace any authority claims to appropriate sources?** (bylaws/board resolutions/charters)

### **Review Checklist Addition**

**Authority Boundary Check:**
- [ ] Document type matches authority level exercised
- [ ] All authority claims properly sourced
- [ ] No governance establishment in operational documents
- [ ] Clear distinction between establishment and reference of authority
- [ ] Document scope remains within appropriate boundaries

### **Training and Awareness**

**For Document Creators:**
- Understanding of different document types and their authority scope
- Training on referencing vs. establishing organizational authority
- Guidelines for maintaining appropriate document boundaries
- Examples of proper authority sourcing and referencing

**For Document Reviewers:**
- Diagnostic questions for detecting authority boundary violations
- Correction strategies for scope creep and governance overreach
- Understanding of organizational authority hierarchy and sources
- Framework for recommending governance separation when needed

## EXAMPLE APPLICATION

**BEFORE Enhancement (Problematic):**
*Operational subroutine contains: "The Program Director has authority for content review. Quality assurance requires peer review before release. This establishes the following governance framework..."*

**AFTER Enhancement (Corrected):**
*Operational subroutine contains: "Content follows quality assurance procedures established in the Network Society Program Charter. Implementation of review processes follows existing organizational guidelines."*

**DA Analysis Would Flag:**
- Authority establishment in operational document
- Governance framework creation outside appropriate document type
- Unsourced authority claims requiring organizational validation
- Scope creep requiring governance separation

This enhancement transforms authority boundary violations from hidden risks into detectable and correctable issues during document analysis.
